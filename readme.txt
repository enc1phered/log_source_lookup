# program idea

*Produce mapping of MDE/DefenderXDR data sources (tables) to MITRE techniques
*Produce human readible index to enable rapid identification of tables of interest
*Produce logic to, based on industry, prioritize coverage gaps by accentuating the cells (I.E tying gaps to threat objectives for finance/defense/hospitality/etc)
*Leverage OSSEM-DM for heavy lifting: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OTRF/OSSEM-DM/03404288803c743cd5254f8888d664a5a106ec89/use-cases/mitre_attack/techniques_to_events_mapping.json
*Overlay table information atop attack navigator layer
